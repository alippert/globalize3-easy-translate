This plugin adds a method to easily access translation attributes.  So if you have a 
translated attribute title in your post model,you can now access the english version 
of the attribute you would call en_title an your post object, here is an example:
post = Post.new(:title => "My title")
post.en_title

this will print out "My title".  To activate the easy access methods, just 
add the following line to your model and pass it the hash of short locale 
names you want to have easy access to:

easy_translate :locales => ["en", "ar"]
